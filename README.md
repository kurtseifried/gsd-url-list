# gsd-url-list

GSD URL List - the headwaters for manually entered URL's that feed into the crawler

## /data/tld/

contains one url per line in the file with tld

## /rules/tld/

contains one JSON ruleset per line in the file with tld

## TODO:

What do we do about rules with regex that cover multiple TLD's? Answer: we don't for now. We may need to long term to deal with page farms however.
